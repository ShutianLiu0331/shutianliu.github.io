I will be joining the Department of Systems Engineering at City University of Hong Kong as a tenure-track assistant professor in June 2025. 

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University in 2024. I received M.S. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University in 2018 and B.E. from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in 2016.

Openings
======
I am actively looking for Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2025. If your research interests are compatible with mine, please contact me with your CV.

Research Interests
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
